# Property-Mapping Specific Transformations Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented a system where each mapping (key → property) can have its own unique transformation configuration, even when multiple keys map to the same Wikidata property.

## Changes Made

### 1. State Management (`src/js/state.js`)
- Added `generateMappingId(key, propertyId)` helper function
- Updated all transformation methods to use mapping IDs instead of just property IDs
- Added backwards compatibility for existing data
- Storage structure changed from `transformationBlocks[propertyId]` to `transformationBlocks[mappingId]`

### 2. Transformation Engine (`src/js/mapping/core/transformation-engine.js`)
- Updated to generate and use mapping-specific IDs
- All functions now use `mappingId` parameter instead of `propertyId`
- Maintains consistency throughout the transformation UI

### 3. Mapping Lists (`src/js/mapping/ui/mapping-lists.js`)
- Updated `mapKeyToProperty` to generate and store mapping IDs
- Each mapped key now includes its unique `mappingId`

## How It Works

### Mapping ID Format
```
mappingId = "key::propertyId"
Example: "dc:title::P1476"
```

### Example Scenario
When you have:
- `dc:title` → P1476 (title)
- `schema:name` → P1476 (title)

Each mapping gets its own storage:
- `dc:title::P1476` - can have prefix "Book: "
- `schema:name::P1476` - can have suffix " (from schema)"

### Benefits
1. **Independence**: Each mapping maintains its own transformation configuration
2. **Flexibility**: Same property can have different transformations from different sources
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: System can still read old property-only transformations

## Testing
Created test file: `test-mapping-transformations.html`
- Test 1: Creates different mappings to same property
- Test 2: Adds different transformations to each mapping
- Test 3: Verifies transformation independence

## Next Steps for Full Integration

While the core system is implemented, the following areas may need updates for complete integration:

### 1. Reconciliation Process
When reconciliation applies transformations, it should:
```javascript
// Instead of:
const blocks = state.getTransformationBlocks(property.id);

// Use:
const mappingId = state.generateMappingId(keyData.key, property.id);
const blocks = state.getTransformationBlocks(mappingId);
```

### 2. Export Process
Similar updates needed when exporting data with transformations applied.

### 3. Data Persistence
The mapping ID should be preserved when:
- Saving/loading project state
- Exporting/importing mappings
- Creating reconciliation data

## Technical Notes

### State Storage Structure
```javascript
state.mappings.transformationBlocks = {
  "dc:title::P1476": [
    { type: "PREFIX", config: { text: "Title: " }, ... }
  ],
  "schema:name::P1476": [
    { type: "SUFFIX", config: { text: " (name)" }, ... }
  ]
}
```

### Backwards Compatibility
The system checks for legacy property-only IDs:
1. First tries exact mapping ID match
2. If not found and ID doesn't contain "::", searches for keys ending with `::propertyId`
3. Returns empty array if no match found

## Implementation Status
✅ Core transformation storage updated
✅ UI components updated to use mapping IDs
✅ Mapping creation includes mapping IDs
✅ Test file created for validation
⏳ Reconciliation/export processes may need updates to fully utilize mapping IDs
