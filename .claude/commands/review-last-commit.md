# Review Last Git Commit

Review the most recent Git commit to ensure code quality and adherence to project conventions.

## Instructions

1. **Get the last commit details**:
   - Run `git log -1 --pretty=format:"%H %s"` to see the commit hash and message
   - Run `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` to see all changes in the last commit

2. **Review against CLAUDE.md guidelines**:
   - Check if all changes follow the project conventions in CLAUDE.md
   - Verify code quality standards are met

3. **Check for the following**:

   **General Code Quality**:
   - Modern ES6+ JavaScript (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
   - Descriptive variable and function names
   - Small, focused functions with single responsibility
   - Proper error handling with try/catch for async operations
   - Comments for complex logic that add context

   **UI Component Usage**:
   - Component factory system from `src/js/ui/components.js` is used
   - No direct `document.createElement()` calls
   - Proper imports: `import { createElement, createButton } from '../ui/components.js';`

   **State Management**:
   - Convenience methods from `src/js/state.js` are used
   - No verbose `updateState` calls when convenience methods exist
   - Methods like `updateMappings()`, `incrementReconciliationCompleted()` are preferred

   **Code Organization**:
   - Related functions grouped together
   - Modular, reusable components
   - Proper separation of concerns

   **HTML/CSS**:
   - Semantic HTML elements
   - BEM naming convention for CSS classes
   - CSS Grid/Flexbox for layouts

4. **Provide feedback**:
   - List any violations found
   - Suggest improvements for code quality
   - Highlight good practices that were followed
   - Rate the overall code quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement)

5. **Summary**:
   - Provide a brief summary of the review
   - List any critical issues that must be fixed
   - Suggest any refactoring opportunities
